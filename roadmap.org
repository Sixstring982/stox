** TODO Better formatting for SymbolList.

SymbolList needs to look a little better, and should ideally contain
the following information:

1. Icon, describing the current delta from yesterday.
2. Price difference between now and yesterday.
3. Symbol.
4. Number of shares owned.
5. Selling price of shares.
6. Profit made if shares sold (must keep track of buying price, which
   can be an average).

This might be made easier if an interface were returned from the
Market with all of that information.


** TODO Rumors

This is the insider trading portion of the game. Without this, it'll
be a little more boring.

This may require tweaking of the way that the stock numbers are
generated. They'll probably need to tend towards the average more than
they do at the moment.


** TODO Styling
*** TODO Chart styling

The chart already looks great, but it could look a lot better.


** TODO Buying/Selling

We can't buy or sell stuff. That's not going to work!
