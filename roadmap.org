** TODO Better formatting for SymbolList.

SymbolList needs to look a little better, and should ideally contain
the following information:

1. Icon, describing the current delta from yesterday.
2. Price difference between now and yesterday.
3. Symbol.
4. Number of shares owned.
5. Selling price of shares.
6. Profit made if shares sold (must keep track of buying price, which
   can be an average).
